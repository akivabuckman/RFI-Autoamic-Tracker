# RFI-Autoamic-Tracker
A tool to automatically sort incoming Requests For Information (RFI's) by discipline, populate a tracking log in Excel, and send reminder emails to responsible personnel.

The program retrieves metadata from RFI files that had been received. Based on the metadata the files are sorted by discipline. All relevant info is displayed in the linked Excel workbook, including due dates and responsible personnel in both tabular and chart form. Emails are automatically sent to each staff member:
- Each station manager receives the RFI list for his/her station
- Each manager receives a list of all RFI's relevant to his/her discipline
- All staff receives an overall status email

Note: The attached program creates demo RFI files for demonstration purposes
